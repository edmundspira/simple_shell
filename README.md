0x16. C - Simple Shell

Authors: Generated at: AUTHORS file

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
Your shell should not have any memory leaks
No more than 5 functions per file
All your header files should be include guarded
Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
Write a README with the description of your project
You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository

Output
Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
Example of error with sh:

$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
Same error with your program hsh:

$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$



Compilation
Your shell will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh


Testing
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
But also in non-interactive mode:

$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
